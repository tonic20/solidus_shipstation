Solidus/ShipStation Integration
==============================
[![TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/boomerdigital/solidus_shipstation.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/boomerdigital/solidus_shipstation) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/boomerdigital/solidus_shipstation/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/boomerdigital/solidus_shipstation)

This gem integrates [ShipStation](http://www.shipstation.com) with [Solidus](http://solidus.io), a fork of [Spree](http://spreecommerce.com). It enables ShipStation to pull shipments from the system and update tracking numbers. This integration is a fork of http://github.com/DynamoMTL/spree_shipstation to make compatible with Solidus and Rails 4.2+.

## Integration Overview

`solidus_shipstation` exposes two API endpoints for ShipStation's Custom Store API to **pull** data from:

**GET /shipstation**
Will return an XML formatted, paginated list of order/shipment details for the requested time frame and conforms to [ShipStation's specifed XML schema](https://help.shipstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/205928478-ShipStation-Custom-Store-Development-Guide#4b). However, in practice, ShipStation will use a narrow time frame (1 day) to request order updates. You can configure how often data is pulled in the ShipStation UI.

```ruby
# GET Example
localhost:3000/shipstation?action=export&end_date=12%2F31%2F2016+00%3A00&format=xml&start_date=01%2F01%2F2016+00%3A00
```

**POST /shipstation**
This endpoint allows ShipStation to send updates on a shipment. Below are the parameters you can expect to receive from ShipStation:

```ruby
{
 "SS-UserName"=>"this-is-my-username",
 "SS-Password"=>"this-is-my-password",
 "action"=>"shipnotify",
 "order_number"=>"R1334232",
 "carrier"=>"UPS",
 "service"=>"USPS Priority",
 "tracking_number"=>"12312312001303",
 "format"=>"xml"
}
```

```ruby
# POST Example
localhost:3000/shipstation?action=shipnotify&order_number=ABC123&carrier=USPS&service=USPS+Priority&tracking_number=123456&format=xml
```

## Setup

Add `solidus_shipstation` to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "solidus_shipstation", github: 'boomerdigital/solidus_shipstation'
```

Then, bundle install

    $ bundle

Configure your ShipStation integration:

```ruby
# config/initializers/spree.rb
Spree.config do |config|

  # ShipStation Configuration
  #
  # choose between Grams, Ounces or Pounds
  config.shipstation_weight_units = "Grams"

  # ShipStation expects the endpoint to be protected by HTTP Basic Auth. Set the
  # username and password you desire for ShipStation to use. You should also place these
  # values in to your `secrets.yml` file to make they configurable between stage/production
  # environments for testing purposes.
  config.shipstation_username = "smoking_jay_cutler"
  config.shipstation_password = "my-awesome-password"

  # Turn on/off SSL requirepments for testing and development purposes
  config.shipstation_ssl_encrypted = !Rails.env.development?

  # Captures payment when ShipStation notifies a shipping label creation, defaults to false
  config.shipstation_capture_at_notification = false

  # Spree::Core related configuration
  # Both of these Spree::Core configuration options will affect which shipment records
  # are pulled by ShipStation
  config.require_payment_to_ship = true # false if not using auto_capture for payment gateways, defaults to true
  config.track_inventory_levels = true # false if not using inventory tracking features, defaults to true
end
```

### Configuring ShipStation

To configure or create a ShipStation store, go to **Settings** and select **Stores**. Then click **Add Store**, scroll down and choose the **Custom Store** option.

- For **Username**, enter the username defined in your config
- For **Password**, enter the password defined in your config
- For **URL to custom page**, enter your URL: `https://mydomain.com/shipstation.xml`

There are five primary shipment states for an order/shipment in ShipStation. Order is ShipStation's terminology, Solidus uses Shipments. These states do not necessarily align with Solidus, but in the store configuration you can create a mapping for your specific needs.

ShipStation mapping depends on your store's configuration. Please see the notes above regarding `config/initializers/spree.rb` and adjust your states accordingly.

ShipStation Status Title | ShipStation Status | Spree::Shipment#state
-------------------------|--------------------|-----------------
Awaiting Payment         | unpaid             | pending (won't appear in API response)
Awaiting Shipment        | paid               | ready
Shipped                  | shipped            | shipped
Cancelled                | cancelled          | cancelled
On-Hold                  | on-hold            | pending (won't appear in API response)

### Payment Capture

By default the shipments exported are only the ones that have the state of `ready`, for Spree that means
that the shipment has backordered inventory units and the order is paid for. By setting
`require_payment_to_ship` to `false` and `shipstation_capture_at_notification` to `true`
this extension will export shipments that are in the state of `pending` and will
try to capture payments when a shipnotify notification is received.

## Caveats

1. Removed [#send_shipped_email](https://github.com/DynamoMTL/spree_shipstation/blob/master/app/models/spree/shipment_decorator.rb#L9), which was previously available in `spree_shipstation`
2. If you change the shipping method of an order in ShipStation, the change will not be reflected in Spree and the tracking link might not work properly.
3. Removed the ability to use `Spree::Order.number` as the ShipStation order number. We now use `Spree::Shipment.number`. This was previously available in `spree_shipstation`
4. When capture of payments is enabled any error will prevent the update of the tracking number.

## Testing

Be sure to bundle your dependencies and then create a dummy test app for the specs to run against.

    $ bundle
    $ bundle exec rake test_app

To run tests:

    $ bundle exec rspec spec

To run tests with guard:

    $ bundle exec guard


## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)

## Future Work

- Improve documentation
- Update legacy development patterns (ex: `class_eval`)
- Update XML generation and parsing
